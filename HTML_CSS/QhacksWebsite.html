	<p>Welcome to MERA Study by Hack Yeah! This extension has been created to provide an all-in-one study tool for students.</p>

	<hr>

	<div id="Features">

	<h3>Block distracting websites</h3>
	<p>Social media can be great, but it can also be a huge distraction when you need to study. Use this extension to temporarily block access to these sites to keep you focused on what's most important.</p>


	<h3>Set study break reminders</h3>
	<p>Breaks are important for your mental and physical health. Reminders ensure you take these breaks and stay productive.</p>

	<h3>Watch meditation and yoga tutorials</h3>
	<p>Meditation and yoga have been proven to improve both mental and physical health. Use study breaks to clear your mind and stay healthy.</p>

	<h3>Music</h3>
	<p>Play relaxing background music while you study to reduce stress and help increase focus.</p>

	<h3>Find healthy recipes</h3>
	<p>It can be hard to eat healthy while you're stressed and busy studying. Easy, healthy recipes that are perfect for student are provided.</p>

	<h3 id="OurVision">Our Vision</h3>

	<p>Our team's goal is to create a tool to help reduce the stressors of studying and school for students. We realized that while there are several apps designed to block distracting websites and help create a study regimine, there were none that had all tools in one place.</p>
	<p>As such, we built MERA Study. The browser extension allows students to turn on a website blocker to keep them on track. Helpful break reminders keep students productive and provide tips to reduce stress, such as by trying meditation and yoga. </p>
	<p>These pages provide helpful links to meditation and yoga tutorials, as well as music that can be helpful while studying. Additionally, there are healthy recipes provided to encourage students to be healthy, even when stress is high.</p>
	<p>By encouraging students to work to reduce stress, students are less likely to have stress related health issues that could result in hospitalization. By reducing the number of people in the hospital, the wait times to see doctors for everyone will be reduced. This will have a net positive impact on society.</p>
